# AI-Powered Nutrition Analysis

**Status:** Ongoing

AI-Powered Nutrition Analysis is an intelligent system designed to analyze daily food consumption and provide personalized nutritional recommendations using advanced language models (LLMs).  

## Data Sources
- [Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anasfikrihanif/indonesian-food-and-drink-nutrition-dataset?resource=download) — covering 1,346 Indonesian food items.  
- Supplementary nutritional data scraped from [fastsecret.co.id](https://www.fastsecret.co.id) for enhanced reliability.  

If a food item is not found in these datasets, the system leverages the LLM’s pretrained knowledge as a fallback.

## System Overview
The LLM serves as the core analytical engine, interpreting consumption data and generating personalized nutrition insights and recommendations.

## Current Focus
Currently, the main focus is building the core pipeline and experimenting with the overall workflow to establish a robust foundation for future model integration and analysis.
We are also experimenting with different model architectures to optimize performance while maintaining cost efficiency.
